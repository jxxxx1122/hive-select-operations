# Hive Select Operations Project

This project demonstrates Hive's SELECT operations, including filtering, grouping, and sorting.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Contains HiveQL scripts for table creation, data loading, and queries.
- `data/`: Contains example data file (`score.txt`) for testing.

## How to Use

1. Start the Hive shell.
2. Execute the scripts in the following order:
   - `create_table.hql`: Creates the `score` table.
   - `load_data.hql`: Loads data into the `score` table.
   - `queries.hql`: Runs various SELECT operations.

## Example Data

The `data/score.txt` file contains sample data with tab-separated values:
```
01	001	80
02	002	90
01	003	85
```
